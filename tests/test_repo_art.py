"""The README's diagrams are generated from a spec, so they can go stale the way any
other derived file goes stale: somebody edits a stage name, nobody re-renders, and the
picture describes a version of plexus that no longer exists. The gate re-renders from
the spec and compares bytes. This runs the gate under pytest and asserts on its receipt,
so a drifted drawing fails the suite instead of quietly shipping."""
