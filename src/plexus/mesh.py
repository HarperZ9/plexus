"""mesh.py — discover the wiring: whose output plugs into whose input.

Given a set of manifests, the mesh computes producer -> consumer EDGES: for every
capability a tool consumes, it finds the tools that emit something satisfying it.
This is the layer MCP tool lists lack: MCP tells an agent that tools exist; the
mesh tells it how their OUTPUTS chain into each other's INPUTS.

An edge is DECLARED, not probed. It forms by matching capability strings the
manifests self-report; plexus never imports, resolves, or runs the tools, so it
cannot confirm the cited module exists or that the outputs truly compose. Every
edge is tagged `evidence="declared"` and carries the module its producer names,
a self-reported citation to follow, not a verified receipt.
