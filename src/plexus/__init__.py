"""plexus: capability discovery + auto-wiring for agent toolchains.

Point it at a set of tools that ship interop manifests and declarative discovery
wires producer to consumer into a pipeline, every edge tagged `declared` and
carrying the module its producer names. Discovery does not import or run cited
tools. Optional probe helpers in `plexus.registry` launch owned MCP servers only
when explicitly called. Zero runtime dependencies.
